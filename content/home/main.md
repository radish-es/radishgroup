Welcome to the web portal for Dr. Jamie Baxter's research group at the Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University. We work mainly on collaborative, place-based projects related to land, local governance, and regional food systems, as well as projects on open authorship in legal education. 

On this site you will find links to our current and past projects, a list of members in the group, and access to recent publications. Some projects are hosted on their own site--please feel free to explore.
