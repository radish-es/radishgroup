This is the web portal for [Jamie Baxter's](../authors/baxter) research group based at the Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University. We work mainly on place-based projects related to land, local governance, and regional food systems, as well as initiatives to support open authorship in legal education. 

On this site you will find info about our [current and past projects](#projects), [members in the group](#people), and access to [recent publications](#publications). Some projects are hosted on their own site--please feel free to explore.
