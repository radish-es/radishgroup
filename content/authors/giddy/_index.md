Anna is a second-year law student at the Schulich School of Law and is currently working as a student researcher with [Jamie Baxter](../jamie-baxter). She has a diploma in plant science from the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus, a diploma in viticulture and vineyard management from Niagara College and studied law, justice and society at Dalhousie University where she applied a food systems lens to political and philosophical concepts. Anna has worked in the restaurant industry, on farms and in wineries across Canada and internationally for the past 18 years. Originally from Lunenburg, she is thrilled to be home in Nova Scotia where she hopes to apply her love of food and law to help build resilience in the region's thriving food scene.
