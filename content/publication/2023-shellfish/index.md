abstract: "This research report sets out a framework for proposed legal reforms focused on shellfish and seaplant farming in Nova Scotia's regional food system. Its key message is that right-sizing‚Äùaquaculture regulation in Nova Scotia can be pursued most effectively through a sector-based approach to reform that addresses shellfish and seaplant farming directly and distinctly from the fin-fish aquaculture sector. While the full realization of this model in Nova Scotia might take time, concrete steps are feasible now
and can contribute significantly to a stronger food system in the short and medium term."
