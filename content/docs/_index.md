Think of these docs as a kind of "operating manual" for research and writing in our group. They won't provide answers to every question, but they outline a core set of tools and processes you'll need to do your work successfully. 

The key to that success is ***effective collaboration***. Anyone can create a system for writing and research that meets their own needs when they work on their own. But to collaborate effectively, we need shared tools and common practices for researching and writing that are feasible for everyone to use and follow day-to-day, allowing us to communicate easily with each other and to focus on building knowledge that is well organized and accessible.  

## Start Here

Get oriented by reviewing [key concepts](./intro/concepts), before moving on to [tools](./toolbox/), [file management](./files/) and [writing processes](./writing/).
