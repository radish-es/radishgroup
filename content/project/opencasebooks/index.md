## Open Law, Now

Our open casebooks initiative combines empirical and conceptual research in open text development and per production with development of an experimental platform for law teachers to build open source legal casebooks. The move toward greater openness in higher education is growing, but the degree to which authors of open materials genuinely collaborate with one another to create and maintain those materials only rarely lives up to the open movement’s potential. Our approach aims to change these dynamics by making collaborative authorship of open casebooks itself more accessible and by giving participants the capacity for greater flexibility and creative freedom–including the freedom to sustain constructive disagreement about materials, interpretations and pedagogies within the scope of collective projects.
